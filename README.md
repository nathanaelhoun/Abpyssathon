# Abpyssathon

A Discordbot for my class group, written in Python with [discordpy](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Features

- üèÜ Count the points for all members and output a ranking. A point equals the absence to one lesson
- üé≤ Pick a random member, he/she will have to do this task no one wants to do
- üé≤ Make random teams with the members of a discord role, to gain time for our class projects
- üè∑Ô∏è Create roles in the guild (because we create a lot of roles)
- üèì Last but not least, answers "Pong" to "&ping" (plus a special Medhi version with "&ping2")

See all commands with the `&help` bot command.

# Deployment

If you wish to use my instance of the bot, you can contact me at my email ([See my profile](https://github.com/nathanaelhoun)).
Otherwise you can deploy it by yourself:

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/nathanaelhoun/Abpyssathon
   $ cd Abpyssathon
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with these tokens:

   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=<bot-token-here>
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://<full-postgresql-database-url-here>
   ```

3. Create the database tables with the script `database_creation.sql` in a postgresql database

4. Then launch the bot

   ```bash
   $ python3 bot/main.py
   ```
